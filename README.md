Why this project exists
This repository targets teams that manage infrastructure across multiple clouds and regions. It provides reusable Terraform modules for core cloud resources, a strategy to use S3 buckets across regions for durable storage, and a governance layer built with OPA to validate security and compliance policies before deployment. The goal is to simplify multi-cloud operations while reducing drift and risk.

Core concepts
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Code-driven, versioned, auditable cloud resource management.
- Multi-cloud: Support for major public clouds, specifically AWS and Azure, with consistent patterns.
- Multi-region: Patterns to deploy resources in several geographic regions for resilience and data sovereignty.
- Module reuse: Centralized, tested modules that can be consumed across teams and projects.
- Policy as code: Security and compliance rules defined as code and enforced during the plan/apply lifecycle.
- S3-centric storage: Leveraged across clouds for centralized logs, state management, and shared data while respecting region boundaries.
- Open Policy Agent (OPA): A lightweight engine used to validate policies during CI/CD and deployment pipelines.

Architecture overview
- Core modules: Small, focused Terraform modules that implement a specific cloud construct (for example, an S3 bucket with encryption, a storage account with replication, or a VNet and subnet pair for Azure).
- Shared state and backend: Guidance on securing state in S3 or other backends with versioning, server-side encryption, and restricted access.
- Policy layer: OPA policies that check for encryption, versioning, logging, tagging, and access controls before resources are created or updated.
- Regional distribution: A pattern that creates equivalent resources in multiple regions for resilience and data locality.
- Cross-cloud orchestration: A design that uses module interfaces to hide cloud-specific details behind a common API, so teams can reuse patterns across AWS and Azure.

Getting started
Prerequisites
- Terraform CLI: v1.4+ recommended. Ensure you have a recent version to take advantage of the latest features.
- Cloud credentials: Access keys or service principals for AWS and Azure, configured in your environment or CI system.
- OPA tooling (optional for local validation): An OPA instance or binary to run policy checks locally or in CI.
- Version control: A Git client and a project workspace to organize modules and examples.

Initial setup
- Clone the repository into your workspace.
- Review the modules directory to understand the available resources.
- Inspect the examples to see real-world usage patterns for AWS and Azure.

The installer is designed to set up Terraform configurations, initialize modules, and configure a local policy-check workflow.

Quick start examples
AWS multi-region S3 with policy checks
- Objective: Create an encrypted, versioned S3 bucket with access logging enabled in two regions.
- Approach: Use a common S3 module that supports region-specific configurations and a policy that enforces encryption and logging.

Example Terraform configuration
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
  profile = var.aws_profile
}

module "s3_bucket" {
  source        = "git::https://github.com/ineedfps1bro/terraform-iac.git//modules/aws-s3"
  bucket_name   = "${var.prefix}-logs-${var.aws_region}"
  versioning    = true
  encryption    = "aws:kms"
  kms_key_id    = data.aws_kms_key.kms_key.key_id
  log_bucket    = "${var.prefix}-logs"
  log_prefix    = "s3-logs/"
  region        = var.aws_region
  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = var.project
  }
}
```

Azure multi-region storage account
- Objective: Create a storage account with Blob storage in two regions, enabling encryption and advanced threat protection.

Example Terraform configuration
```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  alias  = "region1"
  is_emulated = false
  subscription_id = var.azure_subscription_id
  tenant_id       = var.azure_tenant_id
}

module "storage_account" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/ineedfps1bro/terraform-iac.git//modules/azure-storage"

  for_each = toset(["eastus", "westeurope"])
  name     = "${var.prefix}-stg-${each.key}"
  location = each.key
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  account_tier = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"
  enable_https_traffic_only = true
  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = var.project
  }
}
```

Module reuse and patterns
- Central modules: Each module implements a single cloud resource or a small, coherent set of resources. This reduces coupling and makes it easier to test and reuse across projects.
- Versioning: Modules are versioned with semantic versions. Consumers pin to a major version and opt into minor upgrades through a controlled process.
- Naming conventions: Consistent naming across regions and clouds reduces confusion and drift. The modules expose clear variables for region, environment, and project.
- Parameter validation: Modules include input validation and defaults. This reduces misconfiguration and provides fast feedback during plan.
- Outputs: Modules expose outputs for other modules and for consumption by CI/CD pipelines. Outputs include resource IDs, ARNs, endpoints, and DNS names.

Policy-as-code with OPA
Overview
- OPA acts as a policy gate before resources land in your cloud. It checks for security requirements such as encryption, logging, access controls, and tagging.
- Policies are kept in a separate directory as code. They are evaluated against plan data, enabling fast feedback in CI pipelines or local validation runs.
- The policy language is Rego. It is expressive and can cover complex policy rules across clouds and regions.

OPA policy examples
- AWS S3 encryption and logging
```
package terraform.iac.aws.s3

deny[{"msg": msg}] {
  resource := input.resource_changes[_]
  resource.type == "aws_s3_bucket" 
  not resource.change.after.encryption.enabled
  msg := "S3 bucket must have encryption at rest enabled."
}
```

- Azure storage account encryption and HTTPS only
```
package terraform.iac.azure.storage

deny[{"msg": msg}] {
  resource := input.resource_changes[_]
  resource.type == "azurerm_storage_account"
  not resource.change.after.enable_https_traffic_only
  msg := "Storage account must force HTTPS only."
}
```

- Cross-cloud policy: tags and cost center
```
package terraform.iac.tags

deny[{"msg": msg}] {
  resource := input.resource_changes[_]
  not resource.change.after.tags["CostCenter"]
  msg := "All resources must include a CostCenter tag for cost tracking."
}
```

Policy workflow
- Local validation: Developers run an OPA check on their Terraform plans before committing.
- CI validation: Each pull request triggers a policy check in CI. If a policy violation exists, the pipeline fails and points to the offending resources.
- Enforcement: The policy layer enforces guardrails across regions and clouds. It prevents risky configurations from applying.

Security and compliance
- Least privilege: IAM roles and service principals are scoped to the minimum permissions needed to perform actions.
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit: Use KMS for AWS and equivalent keys for Azure storage. Enforce TLS for all endpoints.
- Logging and monitoring: Enable access logging on storage services. Emit telemetry to central logging for audit.
- Resource tagging: Enforce tagging conventions for governance and cost tracking.
- Secrets management: Do not store credentials in code. Use secret managers or CI vault integrations.

Multi-cloud and multi-region strategies
- Consistent patterns: Use the same module structure and interfaces across clouds. This reduces cognitive load when teams switch clouds.
- Region selection: Use a region matrix to cover primary, secondary, and DR regions. The design supports automatic failover or manual switchovers.
- Data locality: Place data where it makes sense for latency and compliance. The module configuration allows per-region customization.
- Cross-region networking: Where required, configure VPC/VNet peering, gateway endpoints, and firewall rules to ensure secure access between regions.

CI/CD and automation
- GitHub Actions: Use a workflow that runs terraform fmt, terraform validate, and terraform plan. Then run OPA checks on plan data.
- Drift detection: Periodic plan runs detect drift and flag unexpected changes. Use automation to apply approved changes after policy success.
- Environment segregation: Separate environments for dev, staging, and prod. Each environment uses its own state and backends.

Recommended workflow
- Write and review: Teams write Terraform code and OPA policies. PRs include a plan output and policy checks.
- Validate locally: Run a local plan and OPA evaluation. Confirm policy pass before pushing.
- Integrate: PR triggers CI to run full validation, then approves and merges.
- Deploy: Apply changes in a controlled environment. Promote changes to production after validation.

Testing and validation
- Unit tests: Use Terraform's built-in validation features and static checks for module inputs.
- Integration tests: Consider Terratest or similar tools to validate real cloud state after deployment.
- Policy tests: Use test datasets to validate OPA policies against varied plan data.
- Backups and rollbacks: Keep state backups to enable quick rollbacks if policy or plan fails.

Examples and patterns
- Shared state strategy: Store Terraform state in cloud storage with versioning and restricted access.
- Module consumers: Create a central catalog of modules that teams can reference. Document usage, inputs, and outputs clearly.
- Region-driven modules: Use a per-region module instantiation pattern to ensure region-specific values are isolated and easy to manage.
- Cost awareness: Tag all resources with CostCenter and Owner to support chargeback and cost optimization.

Architectural patterns to adopt
- Idempotence: Modules should be idempotent. Running apply twice yields the same result.
- Idempotent plan: Plans should be reproducible. Lock files and provider versions help stabilize plans.
- Declarative design: Prefer declarative inputs over imperative ones. Let Terraform decide the steps to reach the desired state.
- Observability: Expose metrics and logs for deployment pipelines. Include policy evaluation results in the pipeline output.
- Reproducible environments: Use the same module versions across environments to minimize drift.

Advanced usage scenarios
- Cross-cloud replication strategy: For logs and data, replicate across AWS and Azure with automatic failover patterns.
- Centralized policy governance: Run a centralized policy service in CI and provide policy results to teams during review.
- Secure bootstrapping: Use a bootstrap script from the released assets to set up Terraform tooling and initial policies on new machines.

Security considerations in deployment
- Avoid hard-coded credentials. Use environment variables or secret stores.
- Use dedicated service accounts with scoped permissions for deployments.
- Enforce TLS, restrict public access to storage, and apply network security groups or firewalls appropriately.
- Rotate keys and credentials regularly as part of the release process.
